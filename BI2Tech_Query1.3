This is the SQL Queries related to the Movies Table and Query 1.3

CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    released INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, "Tenet", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, "Wonder Woman 1984", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Soul", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "The Midnight Sky", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, "Godzilla vs. Kong", 2021);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (6, "A Quiet Place Part II", 2021);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (7, "Barbie", 2023);

Using the query editor on the right side of the screen, write SQL code to select all the information in the movies table.

SELECT *
FROM movies;

Write another SQL query that retrieves all the information in the table but this time filter the results so that we only see movies that were released in the year 2021 or later.
Order the results so that the newest movies are listed first.
When you have multiple queries written in a query editor, you can run one at a time by highlighting it before you press "Run SQL". In this case, highlight your new query that answers this question, and then press "Run SQL".

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE released > 2020
ORDER BY released;

You can also use WHERE released>=2021
There are often multiple ways to answer a question with SQL.
